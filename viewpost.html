                        <h2>Nokia X5 rears its notched head, set to be announced on July 11
                        </h2>

                        It looks like another notched display device will be added to the Nokia lineup, only a couple months after the release of the company's first notched handset, the Nokia X6.

                        The Nokia X5 will make its official debut on July 11 and will, as mentioned before, feature a cut out at the top of its display. As you can also see, the model will also have a dual camera sensor on the rear, along with a fingerprint reader.

                        When it comes to the design, there is nothing stellar about the phone but it does look clean and simple. According to the folks at GSMArena, the external chassis will not have metal bezels and will also have a display with a resolution of 720p. The cameras on the rear will come in at 13MP and 5MP with a price that will be under $150 USD.

                        Luckily, we don't have to wait long for the official release, as Nokia is set to announce the X5 in a couple of days. It is unknown whether this will arrive in the United States but if the past is any indication, this one might be exclusive to Asia.

                        <h2>Xbox One Insider Preview build 17712 will factory refresh your console
                        </h2>

                    <p>
                        Today, Microsoft released another Xbox One Insider Preview to members of the Skip Ahead subset of the Preview Alpha ring, which is build 17712.2000, or 1810.180706-1920. Unfortunately, it comes with some bad news, which is that installing it will perform a factory refresh on your Xbox One console.

                        You might have noticed that since Microsoft started flighting Redstone 5 builds for the Xbox One, some of your apps might have been missing or unable to launch. It turns out that the core OS was corrupted, and that requires a factory refresh.

                        Note that a refresh and a reset are different things. Your apps and games will remain installed, so you won't have to spend time reinstalling everything. You'll lose some data though, as you'll need to go through the out-of-box experience again.

                        This is absolutely the cost of being in the Skip Ahead ring, and it's probably a good thing that this happened so early in build flighting for Redstone 5. The truth is that Xbox Insiders have always had it pretty easy when it comes to stability, even when it was the Xbox One Preview Program. When Microsoft introduced the Skip Ahead ring, this is the first time Insiders have had the chance to take a real risk in favor of new features.

                        Now, you're getting a good look at what that risk entails. This can be a learning experience for you and you can switch to a lower ring while doing a factory reset on your console, or you can soldier on. Remember, something like this could happen again, and you should be prepared for it.

                        Sadly, there was no way around this. While Microsoft said from the beginning that there weren't going to be new features right away, you didn't have the chance to hold off until there were. Skip Ahead signups were for a limited time, so you were either in or out from day one. Unless you disconnected your console from the internet the moment you signed on, there was no way around installing these corrupted builds.
